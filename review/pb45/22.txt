The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. 
Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier,but 
that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. 
Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size,which
permits practical application and optimized implementation,while retaining theoretical
